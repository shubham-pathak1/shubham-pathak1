Hey, I'm Shubham 👋
I’m a front-end developer who builds clean, user-friendly websites and apps. I work with HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS, React.js, Next.js, and Flask, and I’m a Linux enthusiast who enjoys tinkering with open-source tools. My focus is on creating things that are simple, functional, and easy to use.

🌟 Projects

A website for bike enthusiasts to look up bike specs, on-road prices in their city, and nearby showroom locations. Designed to be fast and straightforward.
Krishi Sangam 🌾
A platform connecting farmers with businesses for contract-based farming. Includes a dashboard, English/Gujarati language options, and transaction tracking.
