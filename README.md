# Hey, I'm Shubham 👋

I’m a front-end developer who builds clean, user-friendly websites and apps. I work with HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS, React.js, Next.js, and Flask. As a Linux enthusiast, I enjoy tinkering with open-source tools. My focus is on creating things that are simple, functional, and easy to use.
