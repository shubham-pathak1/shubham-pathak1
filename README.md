Hey, I'm Shubham 👋
I’m a front-end developer who enjoys building clean, user-friendly websites and apps. I work with HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS, React.js, Next.js, and Flask. As a Linux enthusiast, I spend time tweaking my setup and exploring open-source tools. I like making things that are simple, functional, and look good.

🛠️ What I Do

Build websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Create apps using React.js and Next.js.
Use Flask for small backend projects.
Mess around with Linux to make my workflow smoother.
Focus on designs that are easy to use and visually clear.
